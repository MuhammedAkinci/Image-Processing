Hello everyone. I have done some studies on Image Processing, which is used almost everywhere today.
I used the Python software language in my work using the OpenCV library. I used the PyCharm development environment.
The content of my work, which I think will give the person a good foundation, is as follows;
- OpenCV Introduction,
- OpenCV Basic Operations,
- Transactions such as Contours, Convex Hull,
- Hough Transforms,
- OpenCV Exercises and Examples,
- Face Detection,
- Smile Detection,
- Eye Detection,
- Operations such as Face, Smile, Eye Detection in Video,
- Human Body Perception,
- Vehicle Detection in Traffic,
- Creating Your Own Haar Cascade File,
- Text to Picture Reading,
- License Plate Reading,
- Detecting and Counting Vehicles in Traffic,
- Detection of Hand Gestures,
- Drawing on Screen,
- Numpy and Matplotlib
- I covered topics such as Identification.
I hope that will be useful. Thanks.
